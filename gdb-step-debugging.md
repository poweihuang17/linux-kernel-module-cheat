# GDB step debugging

To GDB step debug the Linux kernel, first run:

    ./run -d

If you want to break immediately at a symbol, e.g. `start_kernel` of the boot sequence, run on another shell:

    ./rungdb start_kernel

Now QEMU will stop there, and you can use the normal GDB commands:

    l
    n
    c

To skip the boot, run just:

    ./rungdb

and when you want to break, do `Ctrl + C` from GDB.

To have some fun, you can first run inside QEMU:

    /count.sh

which counts to infinity to stdout, and then in GDB:

    Ctrl + C
    break sys_write
    continue
    continue
    continue

And you now control the counting from GDB.

## Kernel module debugging

Loadable kernel modules are a bit trickier since the kernel can place them at different memory locations depending on load order.

So we cannot set the breakpoints before `insmod`.

However, the Linux kernel GDB scripts offer the `lx-symbols` command, which takes care of that beautifully for us:

    ./run -d
    ./rungdb

In QEMU:

    insmod /fops.ko

In GDB, hit `Ctrl + C`, and note how it says:

    scanning for modules in ../kernel_module-1.0/
    loading @0xffffffffa0000000: ../kernel_module-1.0//fops.ko

That's `lx-symbols` working! Now simply:

    b fop_write
    c

In QEMU:

    printf a >/sys/kernel/debug/lkmc_fops/f

and GDB now breaks at our `fop_write` function!

Just don't forget to remove your breakpoints after `rmmod`, or they will point to stale memory locations.

TODO: why does `break work_func` for `insmod kthread.ko` not break the first time I `insmod`, but breaks the second time?

### Bypassing lx-symbols

Useless, but a good way to show how hardcore you are. From inside QEMU:

    insmod /fops.ko
    cat /proc/modules

This will give a line of form:

    fops 2327 0 - Live 0xfffffffa00000000

And then tell GDB where the module was loaded with:

    Ctrl + C
    add-symbol-file ../kernel_module-1.0/fops.ko 0xfffffffa00000000

## Debug kernel early boot

TODO: why can't we break at early startup stuff such as:

    ./rungdb extract_kernel
    ./rungdb main
