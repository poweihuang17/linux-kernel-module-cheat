# Bibliography

Runnable stuff:

- <https://lwn.net/Kernel/LDD3/> the best book, but outdated. Updated source: <https://github.com/martinezjavier/ldd3> But examples non-minimal and take too much brain power to understand.
- <https://github.com/satoru-takeuchi/elkdat> manual build process without Buildroot, very few and simple kernel modules
- <https://github.com/tinyclub/linux-lab> Buildroot based, no kernel modules?
- <https://github.com/agelastic/eudyptula>
- <https://github.com/linux-kernel-labs> Yocto based, source inside a kernel fork subdir: <https://github.com/linux-kernel-labs/linux/tree/f08b9e4238dfc612a9d019e3705bd906930057fc/tools/labs> which the author would like to upstream <https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/79w2q9/linux_device_driver_labs_the_linux_kernel/dp6of43/>
- Android AOSP: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1809774/how-to-compile-the-android-aosp-kernel-and-test-it-with-the-android-emulator/48310014#48310014> AOSP is basically a uber bloated Buildroot, Android is Linux based, and QEMU is the emulator backend. 

Theory:

- <https://lwn.net>
- <http://www.makelinux.net>
- <http://nairobi-embedded.org/> you will fall here a lot when the hard Google queries start popping
